      Fossil pelvic and leg bones, body proportions, and footprints all read
      "bipeds." The fossil bones are not identical to modern humans, but were
      likely functionally equivalent and a marked departure from those of
      quadrupedal chimpanzees.

          Reconstruction of <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Australopithecine fossils possess various components of the bipedal
      complex which can be compared to those of chimpanzees and humans:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A diagnostic feature of bipedal locomotion is a shortened and broadened
        ilium (or large pelvic bone); the australopithecine ilium is shorter
        than that of apes, and it is slightly curved; this shape suggests that
        the gluteal muscles were in a position to rotate and support the body
        during bipedal walking
      </li>
      <li>
        In modern humans, the head of the femur (or thigh bone) is robust,
        indicating increased stability at this joint for greater load bearing
      </li>
      <li>
        In humans, the femur angles inward from the hip to the knee joint, so
        that the lower limbs stand close to the body's midline. The line of
        gravity and weight are carried on the outside of the knee joint; in
        contrast, the chimpanzee femur articulates at the hip, then continues in
        a straight line downward to the knee joint
      </li>
      <li>
        The morphology of the australopithecine femur is distinct and suggests a
        slightly different function for the hip and knee joints. The femoral
        shaft is angled more than that of a chimpanzee and indicates that the
        knees and feet were well planted under the body
      </li>
      <li>
        In modern humans, the lower limbs bear all the body weight and perform
        all locomotor functions. Consequently, the hip, knee and ankle joint are
        all large with less mobility than their counterparts in chimpanzees. In
        australopithecines, the joints remain relatively small. In part, this
        might be due to smaller body size. It may also be due to a unique early
        hominid form of bipedal locomotion that differed somewhat from that of
        later hominids.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus human bodies were redesigned by natural selection for walking in an
      upright position for longer distances over uneven terrain. This is
      potentially in response to a changing African landscape with fewer trees
      and more open savannas.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Brain_Size">Brain Size</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Bipedal locomotion became established in the earliest stages of the
      hominid lineage, about 7 million years ago, whereas brain expansion came
      later. Early hominids had brains slightly larger than those of apes, but
      fossil hominids with significantly increased cranial capacities did not
      appear until about 2 million years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brain size remains near 450 cubic centimetres (cc) for robust
      australopithecines until almost 1.5 million years ago. At the same time,
      fossils assigned to Homo exceed 500 cc and reach almost 900 cc.
    </p>
    <p>
      What might account for this later and rapid expansion of hominid brain
      size? One explanation is called the "radiator theory": a new means for
      cooling this vital heat-generating organ, namely a new pattern of cerebral
      blood circulation, would be responsible for brain expansion in hominids.
      Gravitational forces on blood draining from the brain differ in
      quadrupedal animals versus bipedal animals: when humans stand bipedally,
      most blood drains into veins at the back of the neck, a network of small
      veins that form a complex system around the spinal column.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two different drainage patterns might reflect two systems of cooling
      brains in early hominids. Active brains and bodies generate a lot of
      metabolic heat. The brain is a hot organ, but must maintain a fairly rigid
      temperature range to keep it functioning properly and to prevent permanent
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Savanna-dwelling hominids with this network of veins had a way to cool a
      bigger brain, allowing the "engine" to expand, contributing to hominid
      flexibility in moving into new habitats and in being active under a wide
      range of climatic conditions.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Free_Hands">Free Hands</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands in locomotion or
      bearing weight or swinging through the trees. The chimpanzee's hand and
      foot are similar in size and length, reflecting the hand's use for bearing
      weight in knuckle walking. The human hand is shorter than the foot, with
      straighter phalanges. Fossil hand bones two million to three million years
      old reveal this shift in specialization of the hand from locomotion to
      manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chimpanzee hands are a compromise. They must be relatively immobile in
      bearing weight during knuckle walking, but dexterous for using tools.
      Human hands are capable of power and precision grips but more importantly
      are uniquely suited for fine manipulation and coordination.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Tool_Use">Tool Use</span>
      
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fossil hand bones show greater potential for evidence of tool use.
      Although no stone tools are recognizable in an archaeological context
      until 2.5 million years ago, we can infer nevertheless their existence for
      the earliest stage of human evolution. The tradition of making and using
      tools almost certainly goes back much earlier to a period of utilizing
      unmodified stones and tools mainly of organic, perishable materials (wood
      or leaves) that would not be preserved in the fossil record.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we tell a hominid-made artifact from a stone generated by natural
      processes? First, the manufacturing process of hitting one stone with
      another to form a sharp cutting edge leaves a characteristic mark where
      the flake has been removed. Second, the raw material for the tools often
      comes from some distance away and indicates transport to the site by
      hominids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modification of rocks into predetermined shapes was a technological
      breakthrough. Possession of such tools opened up new possibilities in
      foraging: for example, the ability to crack open long bones and get at the
      marrow, to dig, and to sharpen or shape wooden implements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before the fossil record of tools around 2.5 Myrs, australopithecine
      brains were larger than chimpanzee brains, suggesting increased motor
      skills and problem solving. All lines of evidence point to the importance
      of skilled making and using of tools in human evolution.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span>
      
    </h2>
    <p>In this chapter, we learned the following:</p>
    <p>
      1. Humans clearly depart from apes in several significant areas of
      anatomy, which stem from adaptation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>bipedalism</li>
      <li>dentition (tooth size and shape)</li>
      <li>free hands</li>
      <li>brain size</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      2. For most of human evolution, cultural evolution played a fairly minor
      role. If we look back at the time of most australopithecines, it is
      obvious that culture had little or no influence on the lives of these
      creatures, who were constrained and directed by the same evolutionary
      pressures as the other organisms with which they shared their ecosystem.
      So, for most of the time during which hominids have existed, human
      evolution was no different from that of other organisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Nevertheless once our ancestors began to develop a dependence on
      culture for survival, then a new layer was added to human evolution.
      Sherwood Washburn suggested that the unique interplay of cultural change
      and biological change could account for why humans have become so
      different. According to him, as culture became more advantageous for the
      survival of our ancestors, natural selection favoured the genes
      responsible for such behaviour. These genes that improved our capacity for
      culture would have had an adaptive advantage. We can add that not only the
      genes but also anatomical changes made the transformations more
      advantageous. The ultimate result of the interplay between genes and
      culture was a significant acceleration of human evolution around 2.6
      million to 2.5 million years ago.
